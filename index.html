The private ownership has control over the local area network rather than the public. LAN has a shorter propagation delay than MAN as well as WAN. 
                            <br> It covers the smallest area such as College, School Hospital and so on. </p>

                             <br> PSTN or Satellite medium is used for wide area networks.  </p>
